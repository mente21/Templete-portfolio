      detailedBio: "My journey in design began with a simple curiosity about how digital interfaces could shape human behavior. Over nearly a decade, that curiosity has evolved into a disciplined practice focused on pixel-perfection and meaningful user experiences. I believe that every design should tell a story and every interaction should feel like a natural conversation.\n\nI've spent my career working at the intersection of psychology, technology, and aesthetic beauty. Whether I'm building a robust design system for a fintech giant or crafting a playful mobile app for a startup, my goal remains the same: to create products that people actually love to use. I am constantly exploring new tools and methodologies, from generative design to motion-driven storytelling, ensuring that my work stays at the cutting edge of digital innovation.",
