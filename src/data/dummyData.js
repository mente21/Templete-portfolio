      detailedBio: "As an Ethiopian-born student of psychology, I've learned that life isn't about finding a 'workable' path—it's about building a 'livable' one. My story is a collection of moments: the aroma of traditional coffee, the stroke of an abstract painting, and the deep connections formed with those I love. \n\nSince my Stage 4 diagnosis in April 2024, my mission has expanded. It's no longer just about awareness; it's about documenting the beauty in everything from fashion to friendship. This site is a record of that spirit—a place where the daily rhythm of life meets a purpose that transcends the diagnosis.",
